From initial design to sourcing the perfect trims & detailing needed to create a new & unique type of jacket for the group, Jane was knowledgable, reliable, and inspired.

Jane has the greatest variety of outfits and accessories to make it super authentic. The quality of the costumes is great. Jane gave me some different options and helped me to put my outfit together. She even tailored the jacket for a better fit. Super recommended and great value for your money, very affordable.</p>
